- 👋 Hi, I’m @AmosMaddux. I've been educator for over 7 years and am looking to make the change to a career in Software Development.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating applications, games, and other interactive experiences that help people learn to cope with stress and mental health issues.
- 🌱 I’m currently enhancing my skills in Java and Android Development, while working on a mobile-game I have designed. Should be released this year!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects involving Java, Python, C#, or the Unity Engine. Would love to participate, learn, and create something together.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
